## Pet project. Open "DTF.ru / VC.ru / TJournal.ru" like service.

This is **frontend only**. Backend development is here: https://github.com/devilstars/opendtf 

OpenDTF is an open source website boilerplate based upon the popular Cmtt service network. It attempts to mimic the original service as closely as possible while extending it with new features. If I have time to do it :)

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install # Or yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
